# Best App Design Practices 2020

------------
### Optimal mobile app design is the design that is simple to use & achieve the goal without any complexity.
### Why Mobile App Designs are Important In 2020?

#### Nowadays, everyone is looking for valuable information, so it becomes much harder to create attention-grabbing products. Though your product may be valuable, if it is difficult to use, nobody will waste time on finding app flow. Modern design should reflect the latest tech innovations.

### Best Practices in App Design in 2020

#### 1. Animations and Microinteractions
Using micro-interaction you are enabling the user to get interact with the app. It grabs the attention directly and we don't need to add an extra text or anything.
#### 2. 3D objects
3d objects allow the user to get a more realistic experience which will create interest in your product. When users view and touch a product it creates emotion and interest in conversion.
#### 3. New Skeuomorphism
Besides the 3d model or object, these style elements also create an effect like real-world objects. Which is now known as neumorphism. Details, shade & light create an effect that the user feels as realistic.

#### 4. Storytelling
Storytelling is all about providing flow which has less user interaction and clear thoughts for the user. It is a combination of short texts, informative illustrations, and an uninterrupted UI.

Here's how you can achieve it:

• Use short & simple messages and avoid pop-ups

• Use dynamic UI

#### 5. VR and AR
VR and AR are now coming in all industries apps that were used only in gaming & entertainment apps. It will stand out your app among others.

#### 6. Minimalism
This is my favorite one in which to use space and provides breath to elements. The average attention of humans with apps decreasing and it will continue to decrease so it's difficult to get the attention of the user, That is why minimalism and simplicity are two UX/UI trends that always be in demand.

Here are some examples by which you can achieve minimalism:

• White space

• Hidden navigation panels and bars

• Enough margin & padding around element

A popular example of a buttonless solution is a liquid swipe, which provides a fully intuitive transition between pages and categories.

#### 7. Dark Mode
The Dark mode is very important nowadays to take care of your eyes. As you can see every app is coming in the dark mode which shows that people like black & eye-friendly interface to get interact.

### Let’s focus on some visual elements that popular in 2020:
#### 1) Gradient colors
Gradients have not missed a spot for years. In 2020, it is trendy to use soft shades, smooth transitions, and more variable colors. Designers often use 2 or 4 primary colors and their hues.
#### 2) Translucency
Translucent colors saturate elements with lightness and allow you to focus on various visual blocks without misleading.
#### 3) Roundness
Organic, soft, and asymmetric lines excite feelings of distress, comfort, and safety. They are useful in products that users associate with stress (such as finance, e-commerce, real estate, and construction).
#### 4) Bright neon colors
Shades of purple, pink, blue, and green add the excitement of advancement and creation to the new product.

### Conclusion
#### So the conclusion is today’s mobile app design trends are all about providing the best user-oriented solution in terms of user need with trending designs & technology. Make your design strategy by place your customer in focus to build trust and confidence in your product.
